ðŸ’¡ Note that the app can run natively on Oculus Quest 2. In that case a computer is not required. In order to use the desktop version of the teleoperation application, your PC needs to support Virtual Reality. We recommend the computer to run on Windows, to be powerful enough and equipped with a graphic card.</description></item></channel></rss>
